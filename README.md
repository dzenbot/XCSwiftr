Convert Objective-C code into Swift from within Xcode.
This plugin uses the Java applet of `objc2swift` to do the conversion.

Noticed that the translation is not always accurate? Does it fail at times? Please consider opening an issue in https://github.com/yahoojapan/objc2swift/issues/new.

## Features

- [Powered by Yahoo Japan's objc2swift project](https://github.com/yahoojapan/objc2swift).
- The plugin is available from the code editor's contextual menu.
- Triggers convertion automatically.

## Missing Features

- Language syntax highlight, hopefully with Xcode's current configured theme
- Auto-convert while typing from the left pane
- Set minimum size for each outlet presented in the modal window
- Test coverage


## How to use

Select any Objective-C snippet you would like to convert and right click on it.

![contextual menu](./Documentation/Screenshots/screenshot_contextual_menu.png)


A modal window will be presented, with the left pane for Objective-C and the left one, for Swift.

## Install

Install through [Alcatraz](http://alcatraz.io/), the package manager for Xcode.

Alternatively, clone the project:

1. Build the project to install the plugin. The plugin will be installed in `~Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins/XCSwiftr.xcplugin`.

2. Restart Xcode so the plugin bundle is loaded.
